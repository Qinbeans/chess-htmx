# Chess In Go and HTMX

This is a test on how far I can take my skills as a web developer. I'm quite confident in my abilities with SvelteKit and Go, but I don't really make websites with Go and Javascript alone. I read that HTMX is a wonderful framework for frontend and I believe it's worth a shot.

## Building

There's really no build process aside from building the classes from TailwindCSS. I wrote a custom config for Air (live reload for Go) which automatically builds the styles.

## One command to rule them all

```
air
```

You can install air [here](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air).

## Endpoints

Getting started, these are the endpoints that won't break:

```
/menu
/newgame
```

This is a work and progress, so stay tuned!
